# Omniducer

Redux is fairly low level library and is thus verbose. There are libraries such as [redux-actions](https://github.com/redux-utilities/redux-actions) that can help reduce boilerplate code, this library is one of them. It helps reduce/eliminate the need to write selectors and reducers.

## Installation
```
$ npm install --save omniducer
